Alice: Hi Bob, glad we could finally meet to plan this out.
Bob: Likewise, Alice. I‚Äôve been thinking a lot about the features we need.
Alice: Great! Let‚Äôs start by defining the goal of the project.
Bob: Sure. Our goal is to build a real-time chat application for both mobile and web.
Alice: Exactly. It should support one-on-one messages, group chats, and file sharing.
Bob: Should we also consider voice and video calls?
Alice: For now, let‚Äôs keep it simple. Maybe in phase two.
Bob: Agreed. What tech stack are you thinking?
Alice: For the backend, I propose using Node.js with WebSocket or Golang.
Bob: Golang sounds good, especially for handling concurrency.
Alice: For the frontend, React for web, and React Native for mobile?
Bob: Yeah, we can share components between platforms that way.
Alice: Do we need authentication from the start?
Bob: Definitely. Let‚Äôs use OAuth for Google and email/password as fallback.
Alice: Ok. What about storing messages?
Bob: I think we should use PostgreSQL for metadata and Redis for real-time message queues.
Alice: Makes sense. Do we want end-to-end encryption?
Bob: Eventually, yes. But for MVP, maybe just standard HTTPS and server-side encryption.
Alice: Got it. What‚Äôs our timeline?
Bob: I‚Äôd say 2 weeks for planning, 6 weeks for MVP, and 2 weeks for testing.
Alice: Sounds reasonable. Who‚Äôs on the team?
Bob: You and I are leading. We'll have John on backend and Lily on frontend.
Alice: Perfect. We‚Äôll also need a UI/UX designer.
Bob: I‚Äôll check with the design team this afternoon.
Alice: Great. What‚Äôs the first milestone?
Bob: Basic user auth and chatroom creation within week one.
Alice: What about database schema?
Bob: I‚Äôll draft one and share it tomorrow.
Alice: Awesome. We should also define API specs early.
Bob: Totally. I‚Äôll set up Swagger for documentation.
Alice: Do you think we need a CI/CD pipeline now?
Bob: Yes. Let‚Äôs use GitHub Actions and deploy to Vercel for frontend, Render for backend.
Alice: Agreed. Logging and error tracking?
Bob: Sentry should work fine.
Alice: Ok, we should schedule weekly check-ins.
Bob: How about every Monday at 10 a.m.?
Alice: That works for me.
Bob: Do we have a shared Notion space?
Alice: Not yet. I‚Äôll set one up today.
Bob: Let‚Äôs track tasks in Jira or Trello?
Alice: Trello is easier for now.
Bob: Agreed. Do we need a brand or name for the app?
Alice: Yeah, something short and catchy. Maybe ‚ÄúChattr‚Äù?
Bob: Haha, sounds fun. Let‚Äôs keep brainstorming.
Alice: For the chat backend, do we build from scratch or use something like Firebase?
Bob: I‚Äôd rather build from scratch to control the logic.
Alice: Okay, and message delivery guarantees?
Bob: Let‚Äôs aim for at-least-once, and handle duplication client-side.
Alice: Smart. What about offline support?
Bob: We'll cache messages locally and sync when online.
Alice: Any thoughts on testing?
Bob: Unit tests and some integration tests with mocked WebSocket servers.
Alice: Perfect. Do we need analytics?
Bob: Yes, let‚Äôs integrate Mixpanel early.
Alice: Great. Anything else before we wrap up?
Bob: Let‚Äôs create a shared document with all the action items.
Alice: I‚Äôll take care of that and share it by EOD.
Bob: Awesome. Let‚Äôs crush this project!
Alice: You bet! Let‚Äôs do it üöÄ
